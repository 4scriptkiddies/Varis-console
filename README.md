Intro:
	light version of console for Lord Varys (https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Varys) to rule Seven_Kingdoms incorporated.
	
Usage:
	option 1. Will start 'flask' on localhost (127.0.0.1) with phishing form of facebook (saving stolen to file)
			  and form for credit card "checking" (saving to file and sending by mail(need to uncomment relevant function))
	          Just change ip address to relevant (current: 127.0.0.1)
	          index.html includes little_bird.py as client for option 2. 
	
	option 2. Allowing connection from little_bird to main. Just a tiny bonus with Class as required
			 (not really necessary but let it be for practice), anyway:
				choose 1 to view desktop files(just 'dir' is too boring) cause you saving usable docs, folders and links on Desktop don`t you?
				choose 2 to save screenshot on remote PC(i was curious how it works)
				choose 3 to immediate restart remote PC. Also burn yours PC, paint it blue and throw to sea.
	
	option 3. In case of unwanted person incoming 
			  opens "funny cats" url. You can change it to regular/boring/work site. 
			  For looking like you doing nothing bad.   
			  
Known issues:
	1. in facebook form MUST fill both username and password field (will fix in far future versions)
	2. in Credit Card form MUST fill all fields including "Expiration Date" (will fix in far future versions)
	3. special symbols still not banned in .html and causing not proper respond
